                        If you're a Valve employee, hello and thank you for checking out my website!
                        I really appreciate you taking the time to learn more about me.
                        <br /><br />
                        I'm sure it will sound like an exaggeration, but I have been saying for years that working at Valve is my dream job.
                        My love of video games and interest in the hardware and software you produce is part of it,
                        but the biggest reason is just that I have an immense amount of respect for Valve as a company.
                        
                        I have always been a fan of how Valve is not afraid to push boundaries and try new things.
                        The original Half Life was ground breaking and one of the most influential FPS games ever,
                        and this legacy has continued to this day with Half Life: Alyx being the most impressive VR game to date.
                        And on the topic of VR, it would be remiss of me to not mention the contributions Valve made to consumer VR
                        with helping to create the Vive and SteamVR before there was any significant demand for the technology.

                        I also love that Valve has worked on projects which helps consumers, even if there doesn't appear to be an immediate monetary benefit.
                        Just take a look at the Steam Deck for example. Valve partnered with iFixit to supply parts and tutorials for people to repair their own devices with,
                        provided windows drivers despite not officially supporting the operating system,
                        and even encouraged people to use third party USB-C docks over the official one if they felt it worked better for their use case.
                        These may seem like small things by themselves, but as a whole they show that Valve really cares about its customers.

                        All of this is to say that I hold Valve in extremely high regard, and would love the opportunity to work alongside you there.
                        Should a position at Valve be offered to me, I would almost certainly accept it.
                        <br /><br />
                        So with all that said, why exactly <i>should</i> a position be offered to me?
                        Elsewhere on this website I have mentioned my skills such as programming and debugging, and while I am proud of those,
                        I am well aware that many people have the same if not better credentials than me in those departments.
                        What sets me apart from others though is my passion for embedded systems, fascination with trying new things, and love of video games.
                        
                        Rather than just a job position I want, working on embedded systems is something that genuinely interests me.
                        This is especially true of systems pertaining to virtual reality and other human-computer interaction technologies,
                        as I find them to be the most exciting things being developed today.

                        A major reason for this is that it allows users to have brand new experiences that aren't really possible in any other way, which is something I am a huge fan of.
                        I am more than happy to try out new things when the opportunity arises, and this is true for both my personal life and for work.
                        My managers have praised me multiple times for my willingness to step up and do short stints with other teams when necessary.
                        I have become a fast learner due to this, which helps me settle into any new experiences quickly whether as complex as a new position at work
                        or as simple as trying out a new video game.

                        And since this is Valve, I'm certain that playing video games is a useful skill to have.
                        I've been playing video games as long as I can remember, from in browser flash games as a child to desktop games through Steam now as an adult.
                        In fact I have plenty of experience with Valve's products, as I use Steam for launching games and playing with friends,
                        I have over 2000 hours in CS:GO (although I'm still barely out of silver!), and I regularly use my Index to play VR games.
                        This extends to all genres of games as well, and I can enjoy everything from fantasy RPGs to sci-fi FPS games.
                        <br /><br />
                        Overall I believe I would be a great fit for Valve, and I hope you feel the same.
                        If you have any questions at all, don't hestitate to contact me! I would love to have the opportunity to talk with you.
